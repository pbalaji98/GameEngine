The zip file krajaratnam_lab2 contains all of the necessary materials required to run my implementation of lab 3. 
I completed lab 2 with Praveen Balaji.

All of the events from lab 2 are implemented in a two planet solar system with one moon. All bodies have elliptical orbits (for the extra credit).

Q and W zoom in and out of the screen centre.
Arrow keys move the screen centre.
A and S switch the direction of revolution for the system (counterclockwise and clockwise respectively).
