The zip file krajaratnam_lab2 contains all of the necessary materials required to run my implementation of lab 1. 
I completed lab 2 with Leslie Jones-Dove and Anton Generalov (group of 3 â€” I missed first week and completed lab 1 alone).

All of the events from lab 1 are implemented, but there are two animations implemented as well (a running and jumping animation). Press the left or right keys to trigger the running animation (this also moves Mario left and right, because of lab 1). Press the up or down keys to trigger the jumping animation (this also moves Mario up and down, because of lab 1). Press the F key to increase the animation speed and press D to decrease the animation speed.
